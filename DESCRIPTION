Description: Package for estimating morphological regions without a-priori
    assumptions of region number. Regions are modelled as segmented regressions, and
    best fit model selected based on corrected likelihood values. An expansion on
    the method of Head and Polly (2014), which incorporates multiple data types and
    missing data using distance-based ordination.
